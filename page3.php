			<p>Publishers have traditionally used their own staff to create, review, edit, design, typeset, digitize, and deliver their content to retail partners. But maintaining these specialized personnel in-house and project managing the entire process may not be the most efficient use of resources. Publishers are finding that outsourcing some – or all – of the production process allows them to focus on activities where they can add the most value, such as author recruitment, public relations, and marketing.</p>

			<h3>A complete managed service offering</h3>

			<p>Publishers of all sizes can benefit by taking advantage of the flexibility and economies of scale made possible by Innodata’s full-service publishing processes. Many leading publishing and information services organizations have entrusted Innodata with complete ownership and responsibility for end-to-end content delivery.</p>

			<p>We work closely with our customers to understand how they do business today, their strategic goals and objectives, and identify critical success factors, staff planning, training program, and definition of quality-assurance and quality-control systems. We then create customized solutions to meet those objectives, both today and in the future. Success hinges on developing the correct, measurable quality gates, performing proof-of-concepts, and using customer feedback to ramp up to full capacity.</p>

			<p>This structured approach, with well-defined phases, ensures both Innodata and our customers have a common understanding of the success factors. Part of our ongoing process involves incorporating continuous innovation, adopting the latest technology and methodologies to improve quality, speed turn-around-times, and reduce costs.</p>

			<p>Innodata has a solid track record of optimizing business processes for blue-chip organizations worldwide. While every engagement is unique – and flexibility and openness to new thinking is required from all parties – our proven approach to managing content supply chains informs the success of all our relationships.</p>
